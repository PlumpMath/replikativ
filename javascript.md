# JavaScript

We have experimental JavaScript
[bindings](http://topiq.polyc0l0r.net/replikativ/) for Browser and
nodejs.  There is a nodejs example client in the `nodejs` folder. The
client can participate in the p2p network. To test it you can start a
local peer with
[replikativ-demo](https://github.com/replikativ/replikativ-demo). If
you are interested in using the client, please join the gitter
chat. We would like to make it work with JavaScriptCore on iOS next.

*Any help or patches are very welcome :-)*
