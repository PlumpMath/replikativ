# geschichte

For the documentation look at [introduction](http://ghubber.github.io/geschichte/)
and [synching](http://ghubber.github.io/geschichte/synching.html).

A prototype application, mostly working, can be found here: [lambda-shelf](https://github.com/kordano/lambda-shelf).

## Usage

An outdated example [pedestal](http://pedestal.io)-application can be found
[here](http://github.com/ghubber/ped-geschichte).

Use this to store your application state, e.g. with `om` or `pedestal`, to
easily compose applications and data. It is supposed to eventually work
from JavaScript as well, ping me and I will have a look what is
necessary to make interop painfree. 

*Any help or patches very welcome :-)*

## TODO for a stable release

- Authentication and authorisation based on mail registration and inter-peer trust network.
- Well-defined inline schema definition, investigate `schema`.
- Automatic load balancing to shield network (each peer). Any recommendations?

# long-term Roadmap

- Default to a relational storage with Datalog, implemeting subscribable indexes on transactions (Datoms), to cover most thin mobile use cases with a subscription light (partially implemented).
- Encryption of transaction with repo key encrypted by userkeys, public key schema, explore pub/private key solutions. Maybe metadata signing can work (slowly) on a DHT?
- Add (general) commit graph plotting and a basic web toolbar for applications to communicate their synching state to the user.
- Make usage from JavaScript straightforward (including JSON merging).
- Offer some default (three-way) conflict resolution.
- Implement diverse prototypes, from real-time to "big-data".
- Provide undo and redo for applications.
- Evaluate lowest-common-ancestor algorithms if merging becomes too expansive.
