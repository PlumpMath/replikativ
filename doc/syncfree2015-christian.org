* Notes 8.9.
** WP2: Antidote Overview (Bieniusa)
   - object addressable by {Key, Type, Bucket}, Bucket namespace over
     objects (?)
   - provides strongly consistent transactions with txId
   - can commit/abort/read/update objects
   - type checks
   - partitioned data store by individual vnodes
   - cross partition transactions
   - now more flexible partitioning schemes, e.g. for partial
     replication (?)
   - Publisher per machine, pub-sub better architecture, ZeroMQ
   - txs send atomically
   - resubmission of missed messages
   - most difficult problem: distribution of log, hope that ZeroMQ
     fixes most problems (resending of lost messages,...)
   - riak (not riak core) a lot of prior work on balanching, e.g. all
     nodes suddenly connect to one node on failure, see ricon
     presentations (?)
   - Basho wants to have Antidote working (5 years back)
** Antidote performance graphs
   - from all read to all write vs. throughput (not clear whether with
     durable (disk( or not)
** NMSI
   - strongest weak consistency < strong causal consistency
   - = non monotone snapshot isolation (NMSI)?
   - SI is strictly consistent snapshot isolation, no two concurrent
     writes in snapshot history, see survey on consistency conditions
     4.7.
   - goal to avoid abort messages between DCs
   - problem: forward freshness ?
   - causally consistent snapshot over partitions
   - Antidote uses safe timestamps in DC
   - NMSI uses heartbeat clock in the absence of updates to push all
     objects to same timestamp
   - with no locks -> abort, NMSI waits (?)
   - goal: dependency of each tx is a single scalar -> cannot
     determine object versions from this
   - one problem: blocking reads
   - advantage: healthy partitions make progress
   - example Antidote at t=2 can only read objects with t=2 (strongly
     consisten replication in intra-DC protocol)
   - one can use 2PC at remote sites to make updates visible atomicaly
** WP3: Extended safety
   - Composition
   - scaling CRDTs - problem of basho, problems with very big CRDTs
     + shard sets in different key ranges (independent access)
     + add deltas (state?)
   - sharding generalizes to maps and registers
   - decompose CRDT that can be cached independently, work by Minho
     NOVA, paper published at @CloudCon 2015 Briquemont, Aimeia
   - delta-state based Paper @Middleware 2015, no causality gap
     between datacenters
   - delta-state with operational kernel, paper @ NETYS '15 Amicuda
     (?)
** T3.2. Divergence control and quality-of-data (Jordi Matori)
   - how stale is a replica => bound divergence, NOVA, Inria
   - 1. idea bounded counters => always > 0
   - SRDS 2015 Balegas, Serra, Duarte
   - split keys of map between datacenters
   - support general invariance by static analysis -> guarantees
     problematic concurrent ops not executed
   - repair of invariants (can lead to multiple CRDTs???)
   - metrics: time, value, number of operations
   - collect and distribute statisticial information at different
     replicas
** Simulator
   - use big anonymized log with PeerSim
   - log trace replaying
   - replication protocols
   - divergence metrics
** T3.3 Security
   - access control
   - crypto/homomorphic crypto (cryptoDB)
     https://css.csail.mit.edu/cryptdb/
** Formal language requirements
   - describe use case in english
     + Add counter
     + Leader board
     + virtual wallet
     + shared medical records
   - derive semi-formal specification
   - some temporal logic (?)
   - TLA+ specification
   - can be an combination of CRDTs
   - need way to bring consistency back
** WP2 Next steps (Bieniusa)
   - dynamically changing numbers and locations of replicas
   - what is application? (basho-> gambling bet365 in GB)
   - what is large scale?
   - clients or just DCs?
   - B2B use case
   - support end user devices for placing orders?
   - rollback support
   - important role of bounded counters CRDTs
   - festival use case not with Trifork anymore
   - transfer ideas from SwiftCloud
** Sequence CRDT
   - e.g. text-editing
   - RGA for downstream
   - Treedoc
   - block operation
   - add-remove character in text
   - Idea: add a local data structure to obtain increasing information
     balanced binary tree
   - Apache TreeList (datastructure)
** Formal system weaker model than causality
   - Idea: introduce not not concurrent relation in microcosms
   - world of events (total knowledge but unknown)
   - microcosm
     + only partial knowledge
     + perform deduction
     + internal events
     + <, ||, <>, ?
   - Shapiro: why not: "not <" relation?
   - transition system

* Notes 9.9.
** LASP
   - formal properites
   - basic fault model, crash-stop, anti-entropy, at least one replica
     correct
   - simple lasp program: single CRDT, instance or a Lasp process with
     inputs from a simple Lasp program
   - Fundamental theorem: A simple Lasp program can be reduced to a
     single stream of execution states
   - Meiklejohn and van Roy: A Language for Distributed
     Coordination-Free Programming
   - Plumbtree: Selective Hearing (Meiklejohn, van Roy)
   - Next: Lasp calculus
   - Scenario: Proof that user is removed on all replicas (Isabelle)
   - Next: embed in programming language (e.g. Lasp)
   - highly abstract invariants, only one user at time should be
     possible next
   - quickcheck, wombat (?)
   - Agda (dependently typed), allows programming and proofing
   - C3, DCC tools for CISE => proof consistency, e.g. conflict repair
   - Shapiro: interesting breakthrough, proofs in CISE not exponential
     (due to possible interleavings), only pairwise between replicas
     (quadratic complexity)
   - might lent itself to Quickcheck
   - implementation of filesystem on CRDTs
   - paper: Reasoning ...
   - runtime verification in Antidote, help programmer to analyze and
     detect invariant violation (globally no money is lost)
   - commander tool
   - systemic exploration of interleaving
** WP5: Basho
   - EU would slaughter project
   - D51
